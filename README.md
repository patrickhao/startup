Personal linux environment configuration scripts, including some of my favorite tools

### tmux

After installation, use ```prefix + I``` to install plugins

### LazyVim

After installation, use the following command

```bash
:TSInstall cpp
:TSInstall go
:TSInstall python

<space> c m
// install lsp
```

> To fix a mason config error in LazyVim, open the Lazy UI and press ```C``` and then ```U```, then restart LazyVim and run ```Lazy update``` again to update Mason.
